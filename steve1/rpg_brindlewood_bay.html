        <summary>Keeper Tips</summary>
        <br>

            <li>Fiction -> Move -> Fiction.</li>
            <li>Remind players to use their 'Cozy Place' items.</li>
            <li>Point to items which can be added to the 'Cozy Place'.</li>

    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Conditions</summary>
        <br>
            <li>Conditions are usually negative traits imposing disadvantage on dice rolls.</li>
            <li>A character can have up to three conditions.</li>
            <li>Instead of a 4th condition, make the move 'Putting on a Crown'.</li>

        <summary>Putting on a Crown</summary>
        <p>When text from those sections is marked during play, the player of the Maven in question must do as the text instructs. This frequently means narrating a very specific type of scene. Players can narrate such scenes whenever they wish, but must do so before the End of Session</p>
        <details>
            <summary>The Crown of the Queen (Choose and mark one.)</summary>
            <p>The Crown of the Queen represents the idea of your Maven as a woman. The text involves flashbacks to her life as a partner, mother, and sister; and present-day scenes that show her being romantic or sexual, or having a complicated inner life. The entries can be marked in any order.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A flashback of your fondest memory of your late partner.</li>
                <li>A flashback showing how you were an imperfect sister or daughter.</li>
                <li>A flashback showing how you were an imperfect mother.</li>
                <li>A flashback of your fondest memory with one of your children.</li>
                <li>A scene in the present day showing a private side of you very few get to see.</li>
                <li>A scene in the present day showing a burgeoning romance.</li>
                <li>A scene in the present day showing how you satisfy your physical desires.</li>
            </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>The Crown of the Void (Mark the first empty box)</summary>
            <p>The Crown of the Void represents the effects of the dark conspiracy on your Maven. The text is always marked in order, and the last box heralds your Maven's retirement from the game.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>A Shadow in the Garden.</b> Hereafter, during cozy vignettes focused on you or Cozy Move scenes involving you, you must also narrate how dark entities subtly reveal themselves in the scene.</li>
                <li><b>The Chariot.</b> Your Reason modifier is reduced by 1 and your Sensitivity modifier is increased by 1.</li>
                <li><b>Pallid Mask.</b> Hereafter, during any intimate conversation with another character, you must make a casual reference to death, dying, the afterlife, or the End of All Things—no matter the subject at-hand.</li>
                <li><b>The Pomegranate Kernel.</b> You take the Condition: Obsessed with the Void. It can never be cleared.</li>
                <li><b>The Void.</b> Retire your character in a way that shows how they are lost to the Void.</li>
            </ul>
        </details>     
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Contacts (My Homebrew)</summary>
        <ul>
            <li>The Computer Geeks - They are quite infatuated by you and might show up at odd times to show you their latest gadget.</li>
            <li>The Magnum - They know a lot about guns and ammo.</li>
            <li>The Tinfoil Hat - If there's a conspiracy, they probably know something about it. Loopy as a fruitcake.</li>
            <li>The Copper - They can access criminal records and storage, for a price...</li>
            <li>The Mad Scientist - Always cooking up a new perfume - or poison.</li>
        </ul>
    </details>
    
    <details>
        <summary>End of Session Questions</summary>
        <p>The first question is always marked. Mark 2 more at the start of each session.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Did the Murder Mavens solve a mystery?</li>
            <li>Did you secretly undermine the authority of a local official?</li>
            <li>Did you share your wisdom with a young person?</li>
            <li>Did you share a memory of a late family member?</li>
            <li>Did you behave like a woman half your age?</li>
            <li>Did you dote on someone?</li>
            <li>Did you show someone that you've “still got it?”</li>
        </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>XP Track</summary>
        <p>When you mark all five boxes on the XP track, erase them whenever you wish and mark an advancement (see Advancements, below). There are two ways to mark the XP track:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>By answering “yes” to an End of Session question.
            <li>When the text of a move instructs you to.</li>
        </li>
    </details>
    
    <details>
        <summary>Advancements</summary>
        <p>When you mark an advancement, immediately apply its effects to your character sheet. When all advancements have been marked, your Maven can no longer collect XP or advance, but they are in play until forced to retire by The Crown of the Void or until you decide to retire them (see Putting on a Crown).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Increase an ability modifier by 1 (max 3).</li>
            <li>Increase an ability modifier by 1 (max 3).</li>
            <li>Choose an additional Maven move.</li>
            <li>Choose an additional Maven move.</li>
            <li>Unmark all the items in your Cozy Little Place.</li>

            <p>Top floor of The Candlelight Booksellers, during the weekly meeting of the Murder Mavens mystery book club.</p>
            <p class="text-frame" id="display-bb-post-roll5">Paint the Scene:<br><i>As the camera pans around the loft where you hold your Murder Mavens meetings, what do we see that shows how you have personalized the space?</i></p>
            <p>Just as their meeting is ending, the Mavens are approached by Brindlewood County's chief law enforcement officer, Sheriff Wyman Dalrymple. He tells them that, earlier today, a wealthy financier, Albert Krause, was dragged out of the bay, dead. Mr. Krause and his family were on a yachting vacation and their boat is presently anchored a quarter mile from shore. The surviving Krauses—wife Allison, eldest daughter Sara, son David, and youngest daughter Emily—assert Mr. Krause was drunk and simply fell overboard. Sheriff Dalrymple suspects foul play but if he can't produce evidence to that effect soon, he'll be forced to let the family take Albert back to Boston. The body is currently being held in a cold storage at the fish market until the matter can be sorted out.</p>
            <p class="text-frame" id="display-bb-post-roll5">Establishing Question:<br><i>You met one of the Krause children several years ago. What were the circumstances around that meeting?</i></p>
            <p>Sheriff Dalrymple needs the Mavens' help in proving foul play. He emphasizes to them that he does not need them to solve the whole mystery — that's what the sheriff's department is for. Of course, Murder Mavens are going to do what Murder Mavens are going to do…</p>

                <p>Jowly, paunchy, speaks with a permanently exasperated tone. Without anything to go on, he'll have to let the Krauses raise anchor and leave. He's reluctant to ask the Murder Mavens for their help, but he knows they have had some success solving cases in the past.</p>

Naturally, she's upset about the death of her husband, but she seems equally distraught about how all of this might affect the 4th Annual Warrior's Ball, an upcoming charity event for veterans suffering from testicular cancer that she's hosting a week from now.</p>
