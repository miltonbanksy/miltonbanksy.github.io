        <summary>Putting on a Crown</summary>
        <p>When text from those sections is marked during play, the player of the Maven in question must do as the text instructs. This frequently means narrating a very specific type of scene. Players can narrate such scenes whenever they wish, but must do so before the End of Session</p>
        <details>
            <summary>The Crown of the Queen (Choose and mark one.)</summary>
            <p>The Crown of the Queen represents the idea of your Maven as a woman. The text involves flashbacks to her life as a partner, mother, and sister; and present-day scenes that show her being romantic or sexual, or having a complicated inner life. The entries can be marked in any order.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A flashback of your fondest memory of your late partner.</li>
                <li>A flashback showing how you were an imperfect sister or daughter.</li>
                <li>A flashback showing how you were an imperfect mother.</li>
                <li>A flashback of your fondest memory with one of your children.</li>
                <li>A scene in the present day showing a private side of you very few get to see.</li>
                <li>A scene in the present day showing a burgeoning romance.</li>
                <li>A scene in the present day showing how you satisfy your physical desires.</li>

        <details>
            <summary>The Crown of the Void (Mark the first empty box)</summary>
            <p>The Crown of the Void represents the effects of the dark conspiracy on your Maven. The text is always marked in order, and the last box heralds your Maven's retirement from the game.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>A Shadow in the Garden.</b> Hereafter, during cozy vignettes focused on you or Cozy Move scenes involving you, you must also narrate how dark entities subtly reveal themselves in the scene.</li>
                <li><b>The Chariot.</b> Your Reason modifier is reduced by 1 and your Sensitivity modifier is increased by 1.</li>
                <li><b>Pallid Mask.</b> Hereafter, during any intimate conversation with another character, you must make a casual reference to death, dying, the afterlife, or the End of All Things—no matter the subject at-hand.</li>
                <li><b>The Pomegranate Kernel.</b> You take the Condition: Obsessed with the Void. It can never be cleared.</li>
                <li><b>The Void.</b> Retire your character in a way that shows how they are lost to the Void.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>The Magnum - They know a lot about guns and ammo.</li>
            <li>The Tinfoil Hat - If there's a conspiracy, they probably know something about it. Loopy as a fruitcake.</li>
            <li>The Copper - They can access criminal records and storage, for a price...</li>
            <li>The Mad Scientist - Always cooking up a new perfume - or poison.</li>

        <summary>End of Session Questions</summary>
        <p>The first question is always marked. Mark 2 more at the start of each session.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Did the Murder Mavens solve a mystery?</li>

        </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>XP Track</summary>
        <p>When you mark all five boxes on the XP track, erase them whenever you wish and mark an advancement (see Advancements, below). There are two ways to mark the XP track:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>By answering “yes” to an End of Session question.
            <li>When the text of a move instructs you to.</li>
        </li>
    </details>
    
    <details>
        <summary>Advancements</summary>
        <p>When you mark an advancement, immediately apply its effects to your character sheet. When all advancements have been marked, your Maven can no longer collect XP or advance, but they are in play until forced to retire by The Crown of the Void or until you decide to retire them (see Putting on a Crown).</p>

            <p>Top floor of The Candlelight Booksellers, during the weekly meeting of the Murder Mavens mystery book club.</p>
            <p class="text-frame" id="display-bb-post-roll5">Paint the Scene:<br><i>As the camera pans around the loft where you hold your Murder Mavens meetings, what do we see that shows how you have personalized the space?</i></p>
            <p>Just as their meeting is ending, the Mavens are approached by Brindlewood County's chief law enforcement officer, Sheriff Wyman Dalrymple. He tells them that, earlier today, a wealthy financier, Albert Krause, was dragged out of the bay, dead. Mr. Krause and his family were on a yachting vacation and their boat is presently anchored a quarter mile from shore. The surviving Krauses—wife Allison, eldest daughter Sara, son David, and youngest daughter Emily—assert Mr. Krause was drunk and simply fell overboard. Sheriff Dalrymple suspects foul play but if he can't produce evidence to that effect soon, he'll be forced to let the family take Albert back to Boston. The body is currently being held in a cold storage at the fish market until the matter can be sorted out.</p>
            <p class="text-frame" id="display-bb-post-roll5">Establishing Question:<br><i>You met one of the Krause children several years ago. What were the circumstances around that meeting?</i></p>
            <p>Sheriff Dalrymple needs the Mavens' help in proving foul play. He emphasizes to them that he does not need them to solve the whole mystery — that's what the sheriff's department is for. Of course, Murder Mavens are going to do what Murder Mavens are going to do…</p>

                <summary>Captain Curly, the yacht captain</summary>
                <p>Dazzling officer's whites. Megawatt smile. Gray at the temples. Captain Carl “Curly” Willoughby has worked for the Krause family for years. He's a Brindlewood Bay native, and the reason the family vacations here.</p>
                <p>Quote: <i>“I convinced Mr. and Mrs. Krause to start coming out this way about ten years ago. Brindlewood Bay was a backwater as far as they were concerned, but I've been slowly teaching them about the local history and culture. Are you a native of Brindlewood Bay?”</i></p>

                <summary>Etienne Beauregard, a fishmonger</summary>
                <p>Silver beard. Hale. Does a “romantic Frenchman of the sea” performance for tourists, but is actually from Scranton. Etienne is an old friend of the Krauses, and has agreed to store Albert's body as a kindness to the family.</p>
                <p>Quote: <i>“I'd do anything for the Krauses. Everything I have in this world is because of them. When they told me they needed somewhere cold to store Albert's body, I was more than happy to make room between the cod and the pollock.”</i></p>
